title: "A bit about me"
---

I have been a management consultant for over 15 years, delivering large-scale transformation, strategy, and operational improvement programs across financial services and corporate sectors.

I specialize in structuring ambiguous problems, applying data-driven analysis, and building execution roadmaps that achieve measurable business outcomes.

I began my career at McKinsey before moving in-house as an advisor and execution partner to senior executives and boards, where stakeholder alignment, analytical rigor, and execution discipline mattered most. 

Most recently, I’ve focused on how to leverage data science and analytics to quantifying value pools and drive measurable lift in revenue, margin, and CX.

When I’m not nerding out on strategy and tech, you’ll find me hiking, reading, traveling, or getting lost in a good puzzle or a good book.
